//Let Us Be Weightless// is truly an interactive short story. What you have in front of you is part one, which was first conceived in response to the //Material Conditions 1// small art challenge, launched by salt.codes and supported by the Immersive Realities Labs for the humanities (irlHumanities). <br>

When I received my crowdsourced creation prompt, I was in the middle of teaching my //Deep Time: Memory, Media, and Ecological Imagination in the Americas// course. My prompt inspired me to rethink what we know about modern technological formations, particularly given my course's emphasis on identifying and attending to the diverse ecologics of people of color in the Americas. <br>

<div class="text-tt">Despite her joking— poking fun at elders going to war over stormtalking emojis has become one of Kaykay's favorite pastimes— you also know that she is feeling it too. The persistent high pressure weather system has been getting to everyone. Normally, most people appreciated the sunny weather and coastal vibes, but it had begun to feel like the intervals between storms were becoming too long. //Too much high pressure outside//, old folks say, //brews too much pressure on the inside...//<br>

A bit ruefully, you wonder if you are slowly morphing into an old person.<br>

Taking a bite from your spirulina= bar, you remember how K's hilariously edgy stormcall dance out at [[the shallows]] had leavened some of what had become an endlessly rising sharpness in your chest, converting it into something else, something old yet familiar.<br>

It was [[mesmerizing]].

!The Shallows

The discovery that during storms we could walk on [[oceans]], and that the story-state could protect us from drowning in deep waters, was a boon for conch and human alike. For the conches it meant a better balance between breeding and storyholding. For the humans it meant a reduction in the number of complex rituals meant to determine who could make a tell when. Everyone understood that, without conches and the story-state they offered, drowning on land would become increasingly common. But after the discovery of the walking, and girded with speed and practice, tellers could now fan out across a broad area, the walking now making it possible for more conches to be entreated by more people.<br>

Before walking, talkers would gather for conches in the shallows, in the lakes and ponds and also in the bayous facing the mainland. Talkers sought conches in places where they could slip easily [[into and under the water->uncle]], using the sinking breath to rise into descent, and then carefully floating back to shore, story told and guided by their anchor stone.

"It was good that we could go to the shallows, because back then it was like we needed to go all the time, you know. None of this waiting on storms... Hell I'm sure I would've been there everyday. If I could've been." <br>

"But you couldn't have!" you blurt out. <br>

You feel your face darkening, but your uncle's kind grin erases some of the shame you feel for shouting the obvious into the blue black of memory.<br>

<div class="text-tt">
Your body relaxes as you cross your legs, nestling your glass [[whetting bottle]] in the crook between ankle and thigh. You've been carrying the bottle for days, storm waiting. The metal is cool against your legs in the heavy air.<br>

It was [[Malv]] who gave you the small and beautifully carved wooden box that holds your whetting bottle, a little while after it all first happened. Thoughtful, you stare out at the water as you mindlessly pass your thumb over it. In your uncle's grandfather's time, which was not particularly unlike the time before, it was believed that drinking water [[tinctured->tincture]] with chlorophyll and algae focused the mind, "sharpened the words." You like to imagine that the grassy flavor is to remind you that you are as much made of land as you are of sea. The oxygen green surface of an indigo vat, the entrance to its deep blue.<br>

You notice that more people have arrived on the beach. Out of courtesy you avert your eyes as others join the gather. Most talkers, like you, have simply taken to almost always wearing [[undergarments that double as perfectly respectable sea clothes ->Seaware]]. But tellings have always been private affairs, even though so much of modern society has arranged itself around making them available to everyone. Friends and family or even co-workers might arrive to the water together but, as they approached the shore, silence would open, and each would head off to their own solitary spot.<br>

You smile, thinking about how difficult it used to be to resist yelling out a greeting to a school-friend, or to tell someone how much you liked the color of their seaware. //[[The quiet, ->mazuko]]// your teacher once said, //is what makes the gather possible//.<br>
